# Defining Data Science



## What is Data?
In our everyday life, we are constantly surrounded by data. The text you are reading now is data.  The list of phone numbers of your friends in your smartphone is data, as well as the current time displayed on your watch. As human beings, we naturally operate with data by counting the money we have or by writing letters to our friends.


## What is Data Science?

In [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science), **Data Science** is defined as *a scientific field that uses scientific methods to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data, and apply knowledge and actionable insights from data across a broad range of application domains*.

This definition highlights the following important aspects of data science:

* The main goal of data science is to **extract knowledge** from data, in other words - to **understand** data, find some hidden relationships and build a **model**.
* Data science uses **scientific methods**, such as probability and statistics.  In fact, when the term *data science* was first introduced, some people argued that data science was just a new fancy name for statistics.  Nowadays it has become evident that the field is much broader.    
* Obtained knowledge should be applied to produce some **actionable insights**, i.e. practical insights that you can apply to real business situations.
* We should be able to operate on both **structured** and **unstructured** data.  We will come back to discuss different types of data later in the course.
* **Application domain** is an important concept, and data scientists often need at least some degree of expertise in the problem domain, for example: finance, medicine, marketing, etc.
